            <h3>About the Formula SAE Project</h3>
            <p>
                The Formula SAE project was focused on building a high-performance racecar. The key stages of the project being in design, fabrication, and testing.  My technical roles in this project were with the Aerodynamics team and manufacturing.

                <br><br>The Formula SAE competition is a high caliber collegiate competition that's held every year. The particular intrigue of the project in 2022 was the addition of a senior design project. The goal was to add control surfaces on the wings of the car to improve turning capabilities by adding to the effect of steering.

                <br><br>Since the team had a race car from previous competitions, the Aero team just needed to retrofit newly designed parts for the car while thinking about building a new one. That's where we started; I began modeling a nose with the front wing as well as small pieces of the diffuser for the car in SOLIDWORKS. To visualize and estimate the aerodynamic effects of these parts I shared in the computing of CFD simulations.

                <br><br>The molds were machined out and we began manufacturing the parts. The aerodynamic additions were made with composites. I got my first experience with doing composite layups making wings, nose, and diffuser. I also did small scale welding to integrate these parts with the car build and create replacement parts.

                <br><br>The team had a succesful, competitive run in Michigan to cap off the project.

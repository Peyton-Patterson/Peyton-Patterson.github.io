            <h2>Oklahoma Aerospace Institute for Research and Education</h2>
            <p>
                As an Engineering Technician for OAIRE, I was responsible for performing maintenance on aircraft and contributing to data collection
                across various research projects. To further support the team, I obtained my pilot's license, allowing me to actively participate 
                in test flights for unmanned aircraft. Additionally, I launched weather balloons for data collection in studies related to 
                tornado acoustics, atmospheric composition, and other weather phenomena.

            <h2>CoRAL Undergraduate Research</h2>
            <p>
                With a strong interest in software development, I contributed to the design of a drone simulation program at CoRAL. 
                The software was developed with a Python backend and a C++ interface, aimed at providing pilots with real-time flight 
                predictions and data. This system is an example of "human-in-the-loop" autonomy, 
                enhancing the pilot's decision-making and overall flight effectiveness.

            <h2>Other Software Projects</h2>
            <p>
                To further develop my software skills, I created programs to assist with coursework, 
                automate iterative design processes, and even explored hobby projects like a Sudoku solver. 
                I wrote code in Python, MATLAB, VBA, and Mathcad, leveraging the strengths of each platform 
                to solve specific challenges efficiently. I also created the website you're reading right now
                to share about me.
